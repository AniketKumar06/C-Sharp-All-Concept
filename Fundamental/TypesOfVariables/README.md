## Types of Variables

01. Local variables
02. Instance variables or Non – Static Variables
03. Static Variables or Class Variables
04. Constant Variables
05. Readonly Variables
 

### 01. Local variables

** A variable defined within a block or method or constructor is called local variable.  

### 02. Instance variables or Non – Static Variables

** Instance variables are non-static variables and are declared in a class but outside any method, constructor or block. As instance variables are declared in a class, these variables are created when an object of the class is created and destroyed when the object is destroyed. Unlike local variables, we may use access specifiers for instance variables.

### 03. Static Variables or Class Variables

** Static variables are also known as Class variables. If a variable is explicitly declared with the static modifier or if a variable is declared under any static block then these variables are known as static variables.
