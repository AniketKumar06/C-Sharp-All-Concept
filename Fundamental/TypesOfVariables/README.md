## Types of Variables

01. Local variables
02. Instance variables or Non – Static Variables
03. Static Variables or Class Variables
04. Constant Variables
05. Readonly Variables
 

### 01. Local variables

** A variable defined within a block or method or constructor is called local variable.  

### 02. Instance variables or Non – Static Variables

** Instance variables are non-static variables and are declared in a class but outside any method, constructor or block. As instance variables are declared in a class, these variables are created when an object of the class is created and destroyed when the object is destroyed. Unlike local variables, we may use access specifiers for instance variables.

### 03. Static Variables or Class Variables

** Static variables are also known as Class variables. If a variable is explicitly declared with the static modifier or if a variable is declared under any static block then these variables are known as static variables. 

### 04. Constants Variables

If a variable is declared by using the keyword “const” then it as a constant variable and these constant variables can’t be modified once after their declaration, so it’s must initialize at the time of declaration only.

### 05. Read-Only Variables

If a variable is declared by using the readonly keyword then it will be read-only variables and these variables can’t be modified like constants but after initialization.
